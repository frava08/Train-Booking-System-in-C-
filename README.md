# Train-Booking-System-in-C-
Console-based Train Seat Reservation System built with C++. Book seats interactively with 3D array logic.
# Train Seat Reservation System (C++)

A beginner-friendly console application for reserving seats in a train coach using C++. This project simulates real-life train seat booking with structured programming concepts.

## Key Features

* Interactive seat booking through console
* Prevents double booking of seats
* 3D array represents coach structure: `train[boxes][rows][seats]`
* Displays seat map after each booking
* Pre-booked seats included for testing

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++
* **Concepts:** 3D Arrays, Functions, Conditional Statements, Loops, Input/Output formatting

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the `.cpp` file in CodeBlocks, DevC++, VS Code, or any C++ IDE
3. Compile and run the code
4. Follow console instructions to book seats

## Program Structure

* `train[10][8][4]` — 10 Boxes, 8 Rows, 4 Seats per row
* `'O'` — Vacant seat, `'X'` — Booked seat
* Users input Box, Row, and Seat number to reserve

## Future Enhancements

* Add seat cancellation option
* File handling for data persistence
* User/admin login system
